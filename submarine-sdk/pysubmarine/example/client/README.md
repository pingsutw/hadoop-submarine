# Submarine Client API Example
This example shows how you could use Submarine Client API to 
manage submarine tasks

## Prerequisites
- [Deploy Submarine Server on Kubernetes](https://github.com/apache/submarine/blob/master/docs/submarine-server/setup-kubernetes.md)
- [Deploy Tensorflow Operator on Kubernetes](https://github.com/apache/submarine/blob/master/docs/submarine-server/ml-frameworks/tensorflow.md)

### Submit Job
1. Create a job description for submarine client. e.g.[mnist.json](./mnist.json)

2. Create Submarine job client
```python
from submarine.job import SubmarineJobClient
client = SubmarineJobClient('localhost', 8080)
```
3. Submit job
```python
response = client.submit_job('mnist.json')
```
### Delete job
```python
response = client.delete_job('job_1586791302310_0005')
```
